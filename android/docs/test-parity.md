# iOS → Android test parity

Every iOS test (`KeelTests/*.swift`) maps to its Kotlin port or says why it has none. Kotlin
test classes keep the iOS name. Suites not listed yet are ported with their milestone
(plan §4.1).

| iOS test | Android | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ThemeColourTests | core/designsystem `ThemeColourTests` | ported (M0) |
| KeelMarkTests: markMatchesTheV2BrandArt, markColoursAtKnownPoints | core/designsystem `KeelMarkTests` | ported (M0) |
| KeelMarkTests: launchMarkAssetIsV2 | `KeelMarkTests.launcherIconIsV2` | adapted: Android has no LaunchMark asset; checks the adaptive icon |
| RootRoutingTests (7) | core/domain `RootRoutingTests` | ported |
| OnboardingStateTests: finishingOnboardingPersistsAcrossLaunches, aProfileAloneIsNotOnboarded | app `KeelAppControllerTests` | ported |
| OnboardingStateTests: markingAgainKeepsTheFirstDate, markingWithNoProfileCreatesOne | core/data `UserRepositoryTests` | ported |
| OnboardingStateTests: emptyDatabaseIsNotOnboardedEvenWithTheLegacyFlag, upgradingUserWithAProfileStaysOnboarded, profileWithoutTheLegacyFlagIsNotCarriedOver | `KeelAppControllerTests.aNewInstallIsNotOnboarded` | N/A: Android never had the Keychain/UserDefaults flag; only the fresh-install case applies |
| OnboardingStateTests: deleteAllMyDataReturnsToOnboarding | | with "Delete all my data" (M6) |
| OnboardingStateTests: restoreKeepsThisPhonesOnboardedRecord, restoreOfAnArchiveWithoutAProfileStaysOnboarded | | with backup and restore (M1 backup / M6 screen) |
| ProfileTests: updateBasicInfoRoundTripsAndClears, updateBasicInfoCreatesAProfileIfNoneExists | core/data `UserRepositoryTests` | ported |
| ProfileTests: ageAndBirthYearAreInverse, derivedAgeUsesStoredBirthYear | | with the Profile screen (M6) |
| ProfileTests: reassignOwnership* | | N/A: no account upgrade on Android (plan D21) |

Android-only tests so far: `UserRepositoryTests` (upsert, pathway, health flag, concurrent
taps, oldest live profile), `LocalStoresTests`, `PathwayTests`, `OnboardingFlowTests`
(screen order, blank name, nothing pre-selected, Continue-only before permissions, double
taps, back), `TwemojiVectorsTest`, `CopyParityTest`, `CopyLintTest`, `LiteralExtractorTests`.
